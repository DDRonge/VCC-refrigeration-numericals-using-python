# VCC-refrigeration-numericals-using-python
I have used two python libraaries for properties of refrigerants, viz. Pyromat and CoolProp. Two different python files are uploaded. I find CoolProp better because it has large collection of refrigerant properties.
You need to install these two libraries into your virtual environment. I have used Pycharm.
